# Quantum Threat Analysis  
## 1. Shor’s Algorithm Impact on ECDSA  
- **Vulnerability**: Breaks secp256k1 in polynomial time.  
- **Mitigation**: Stealth addresses delay public key exposure.  

## 2. Grover’s Algorithm and SHA-256  
- **Pre-image Search**: Theoretical reduction to 2^128 operations.  
- **Economic Feasibility**: ASIC mining dominance negates QC advantage.
